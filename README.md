Here are clear, data-driven insights drawn from the three Power BI dashboard pages you shared (Sales, Orders, and Quantity Sold Overviews). I’ve organized the insights into Overall Trends, Menu Category Performance, Dish-Level Performance, Time-Based Patterns, and Pricing Insights.

📌 Key Strategic Insights
1️⃣ Optimize Around Peak Hours

Focus staffing, inventory, and promotions around 12–2 pm and 5–7 pm.

2️⃣ Leverage High-Performing Categories

Italian and Asian drive most revenue/volume.

Consider:

Adding variations to top categories

Running promotions to lift the weaker American segment

3️⃣ Flagship Items Identified

Korean Beef Bowl (high revenue item)

Hamburger (high volume item)

Promote as signature dishes or bundle them.

4️⃣ Pricing Strategy is Working

Majority of orders fall in the $10–$15 window—keep core menu pricing here.

5️⃣ Growth Momentum Is Strong

With all KPIs rising month-over-month, expansion (menu variety or store capacity) may be justified.
